# simple_ssh_attacker
This is a simple project i did a few months ago to learn python. The lab's primary goal is to write a Python code that performs port scanning on a given target with a Scapy library and then performs a brute-force attack on port 22 using a Paramiko library.  If you have any advice for me, feel free to write.
